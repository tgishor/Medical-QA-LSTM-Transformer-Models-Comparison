2353,35,What is the function of the H19 (ICR) locus in the human genome?,mono allelic expression at the mouse igf2 h19 locus is controlled by differential allelic dna methylation of the imprinting control region icr because a randomly integrated h19 icr fragment when incorporated into the genome of transgenic mice tgm was allele specifically methylated in somatic but not in germ cells it was suggested that allele discriminating epigenetic signature set within or somewhere outside of the tg h19 icr fragment in germ cells was later translated into a differential dna methylation pattern to test if the chicken β globin hs4 chs4 chromatin insulator might interfere with methylation imprinting establishment at the h19 icr we inserted the h19 icr fragment flanked by a set of floxed chs4 core sequences into a human β globin locus yac and generated tgm insulated icr tgm as controls the chs4 sequences were removed from one side 5 hs4 deleted icr or both sides pseudo wt icr of the insulated icr by in vivo cre loxp recombination the data show that while maternally inherited transgenic h19 icr was not methylated in insulated icr tgm it was significantly methylated upon paternal transmission though the level was lower than in the pseudo wt icr control because this reduced level of methylation was also observed in the 5 hs4 deleted icr tgm we speculate that the phenotype is due to vezf1 dependent demethylation activity rather than the insulator function borne in chs4 collectively although we cannot rule out the possibility that chs4 is incapable of blocking an allele discriminating signal from outside of the transgene the epigenetic signature appears to be marked intrinsically within the h19 icr.,0
2353,36,What is the function of the H19 (ICR) locus in the human genome?,a subset of genes in mammals are subject to genomic imprinting the mouse h19 gene for example is active only when maternally inherited and the neighboring igf2 gene is paternally expressed this imprinted expression pattern is regulated by the imprinting control region icr upstream of the h19 gene a maternally inherited h19 icr inhibits igf2 gene activation by the downstream enhancer due to its insulator function while it suppresses h19 gene transcription by promoter dna methylation when paternally inherited these parent of origin specific functions depend on the allele specific methylation of the icr dna which is established during gametogenesis therefore the icr may also function as a landmark for epigenetic modifications to examine whether the icr confers these activities autonomously we introduced a 2 9 kbp icr containing dna fragment into a human beta globin yeast artificial chromosome at the 3 end of the locus control region and established transgenic mouse lines expression of all of the beta like globin genes was higher when the transgene was paternally inherited in accord with this result transgenic icr dna from nucleated erythrocytes was more heavily methylated when paternally transmitted chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that ccctc binding factor is preferentially recruited to the maternal transgenic icr in vivo surprisingly however the parent of origin specific methylation pattern was not observed in germ cell dna in testis demonstrating that methylation was established after fertilization thus the icr autonomously recapitulated imprinting within the normally nonimprinted transgenic beta globin gene locus but the temporal establishment of imprinting methylation differs from that at the endogenous igf2 h19 locus.,0
2353,37,What is the function of the H19 (ICR) locus in the human genome?,genomic imprinting at the h19 igf2 locus is governed by a cis acting imprinting control region icr located 2 kb upstream of the h19 gene this region possesses an insulator function which is activated on the unmethylated maternal allele through the binding of the ctcf factor it has been previously reported that paternal transmission of the h19 silk deletion which removes the 3 portion of h19 icr leads to the loss of h19 imprinting here we show that in the liver this reactivation of the paternal h19 gene is concomitant to a dramatic decrease in igf2 mrna levels this deletion alters higher order chromatin architecture igf2 promoter usage and tissue specific expression therefore when methylated the 3 portion of the h19 icr is a bi functional regulatory element involved not only in h19 imprinting but also in formatting the higher order chromatin structure for proper tissue specific expression of both h19 and igf2 genes.,0
2353,38,What is the function of the H19 (ICR) locus in the human genome?,imprinted expression of the mouse igf2 h19 locus is controlled by parent of origin specific methylation of the imprinting control region icr we previously demonstrated that when placed in a heterologous genomic context the h19 icr fragment contains an intrinsic activity that allows it to acquire differential methylation in somatic cells but not in germ cells in the present study we investigated the requirements for the ctcf binding sites of the icr in the acquisition of post fertilization methylation to this end two mutant icr fragments were introduced into the human beta globin locus in a yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mouse tgm model 4xmut had mutations in all four icr ctcf binding sites that prevented ctcf binding but retained the methylation target cpg motifs and 9cg harbored mutations in the cpg motifs within the ctcf binding sites but each site retained constitutive ctcf binding activity in tgm germ cells and pre implantation blastocysts the absence of ctcf binding sites 4xmut did not lead to hypermethylation of the transgenic h19 icr however after implantation the mutations of ctcf sites 4xmut and 9cg affected the maintenance of methylation these results demonstrated that although the ctcf binding sites are indispensable for maintenance of the unmethylated state of the maternal icr in post implantation embryos they are not required to establish paternal allele specific methylation of the transgenic h19 icr in pre implantation embryos.,0
2353,39,What is the function of the H19 (ICR) locus in the human genome?,one of the best studied read outs of epigenetic change is the differential expression of imprinted genes controlled by differential methylation of imprinted control regions icrs to address the impact of genotype on the epigenome we performed a detailed study in 128 pairs of monozygotic mz and 128 pairs of dizygotic dz twins interrogating the dna methylation status of the icrs of igf2 h19 kcnq1 gnas and the non imprinted gene runx1 while we found a similar overall pattern of methylation between mz and dz twins we also observed a high degree of variability in individual cpg methylation levels notably at the h19 igf2 loci a degree of methylation plasticity independent of the genome sequence was observed with both local and regional cpg methylation changes discordant between mz and dz individual pairs however concordant gains or losses of methylation within individual twin pairs were more common in mz than dz twin pairs indicating that de novo and or maintenance methylation is influenced by the underlying dna sequence specifically for the first time we showed that the rs10732516 a polymorphism located in a critical ctcf binding site in the h19 icr locus is strongly associated with increased hypermethylation of specific cpg sites in the maternal h19 allele together our results highlight the impact of the genome on the epigenome and demonstrate that while dna methylation states are tightly maintained between genetically identical and related individuals there remains considerable epigenetic variation that may contribute to disease susceptibility.,0

2373,17,What is the mechanism of the auxin-inducible degron system?,isolation of a tight conditional mutant of a gene of interest is an effective way of studying the functions of essential genes strategies that use ubiquitin mediated protein degradation to eliminate the product of a gene of interest such as heat inducible degron td and auxin inducible degron aid are powerful methods for constructing conditional mutants however these methods do not work with some genes here we describe an improved aid system iaid for isolating tight conditional mutants in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae in this method transcriptional repression by the tet off promoter is combined with proteolytic elimination of the target protein by the aid system to provide examples we describe the construction of tight mutants of the replication factors dpb11 and mcm10 dpb11 iaid and mcm10 iaid because dpb11 and mcm10 are required for the initiation of dna replication their tight mutants are unable to enter s phase this is the case for dpb11 iaid and mcm10 iaid cells after the addition of tetracycline and auxin both the tet off promoter and the aid system have been shown to work in model eukaryotes other than budding yeast therefore the iaid system is not only useful in budding yeast but also can be applied to other model systems to isolate tight conditional mutants.,0
